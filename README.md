# Coding Challenges Via [HackerRank.com](https://www.hackerrank.com) 

Here you will find my solutions to problems found on [HackerRank.com](https://www.hackerrank.com). Please note that HackerRank simply provides a word problem for which a sofware engineer has to build an algorithm to solve. It is **NOT** about hacking websites, computers & other such tech, in the sense of breaking through the security of a specific software. HackerRank is a site to test the sofware engineers ability to create an algorithm.
